1. Introduction

1.1 Background
Indwelling arterial catheters (IACs) are widely utilized in intensive care units (ICUs) for continuous hemodynamic monitoring and arterial blood gas measurements. However, their use carries notable risks, such as infections and vascular complications.

1.2 Objective
Employ logistic regression to develop a predictive model using ICU patient data, aiming to forecast 28-day mortality accurately. This model leverages clinical and demographic variables to identify patients at higher risk of death within 28 days of admission.

Quantitative Analysis: The project will apply advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to scrutinize the dataset for significant relationships between using IACs and 28-day mortality rates within the patient cohort. This effort will involve adjusting for potential confounders to ensure the findings' reliability and gauge the strength of any associations uncovered.

Risk-Benefit Assessment: A critical evaluation of the clinical utility of IACs for hemodynamic monitoring and blood gas analysis will be conducted against the backdrop of potential complications, including bloodstream infections and vascular issues. This assessment aims to weigh the clinical benefits against the inherent risks.

Clinical Decision Support: The project intends to develop evidence-based guidelines or decision-support mechanisms leveraging the insights gained. These tools are designed to aid healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding the employment of IACs in mechanically ventilated yet hemodynamically stable patients, ensuring judicious use of IACs in the ICU.

Future Recommendations: The project will identify and recommend avenues for subsequent research, highlighting the importance of conducting randomized controlled trials or exploring the creation of novel monitoring methodologies. These recommendations aim to mitigate the risks associated with IAC usage, fostering safer patient care practices in critical care environments.
